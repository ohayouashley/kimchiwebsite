        <h2>Welcome to the recipe page!</h2><p></p>
        <p>I have tried several kimchi recipes myself. After about 15 tries, I have a recipe that has finally provided the perfect amount of sweetness, saltiness, and spiceyness for my pallet.</p>
        <p></p>
        
        <p>Because I have "perfected" my recipe with much trial and error, this recipe means a lot to me and if you are a first-time kimchi maker, I garauntee you will make mistakes. Give it time. You'll definitely get there.</p>

        <h3><strong><u>Instructions:</u></strong></h3><p></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the cabbage. Cut lengthwise then quarter (you can make traditional way here is a link to how you can wrap traditionally. I do it the “Mak-Kimchi” style which is a lot faster/easier for me personally and less of a mess when I want to use it for cooking) – cut into about 2in/3in strips and rinse under cold water. In a large bowl, add two table spoons of rock salt. Add a layer of cabbage leaves down and sprinkle with rock salt, repeat until all cabbage is in the bowl and salted. Fill the salted cabbage up with water and cover. Leave alone on counter for 4 hours, then flip the cabbage in the bowl and leave for another 4 hours. On the third hour – start step 2. After last hour for cabbage soak is complete, drain the water and rinse the cabbage 3 times with running water and let drain for 30 minutes.</li><p></p>
            
            <li>Rice glue (Note – must continuously stir because its very easy to burn! Never stop stiring): in a small saucepan, simmer kelp, dried mushroom, anchovy for 15 minutes. Drain out solid ingredients and bring the broth back to a boil, then add the rice flour and 1 cup of water. Bring back to a hard boil, and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook for 8-10 minutes, whisking constantly, until the liquid is thickened to a ribbon-like consistency and you can see the bottom of the pan while whisking. Set aside to cool in a separate bowl to cool.</li><p></p>

            <li>Kimchi paste: In a big bowl, combine the daikon radish, scallions, ginger, garlic, salt shrimps, anchovy fish sauce, lance fish sauce, plum extract, rice glue, dried fish, Korean red chili pepper flakes, and mix everything well to become a paste.</li><p></p>

            <li>Slowly add the cabbage into this bowl, and rub the paste into cabbage. Make sure all cabbage is heavily coated in paste.</li><p></p>

            <li>Tightly pack the kimchi into jars or containers with tightly fitting lids, making sure it is not exposed to the air. Allow the kimchi to sit at room temperature for at least 2 days, or longer if you desire a stronger flavor (I do three days on my counter). Then put it in the Refrigerate for another 10 days. Once 10 days are up, enjoy!</li>
