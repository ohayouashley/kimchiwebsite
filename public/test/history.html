    <p>Kimchi is, in essence, a living history. The origins of Kimchi, or vegetables salted for preservation, are rooted in the wisdom of ancient Koreans. Ancient Koreans have searched for a way to enjoy fresh and nutritious vegetables even in the coldest days of winter. Todayâ€™s form of Kimchi is the product of numerous attempts at combining spices and flavors, developing along the regional and individual characteristics of numerous years in history. We at bibigo aim to recreate the finest and most healthy Kimchi from the wisdom of our ancestors, who knew the best ways to enjoy Kimchi and its offerings. A product of harmonious adaptations and the steadfast dedication to taste and nutrition, Kimchi is truly the embodiment of Korean culture.</p>
